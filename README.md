# Employees

<img src="./images/EmployeeFrontPage.png" alt="Front page of Employee Directory for Leaders Imagined">
For this project we made an Employee Directory of an fictional company, using react-router-com to build a multiple page SPA, and using an API with multiple endpoints.

I've added the functionality to delete an employee as well.

<h3>On the All Employees Page</h3>
List all the employees for the company
Display details for an employee using api endpoint
each employee gets a page that is dynamically created from the url

<h3> On the Employee Page <h3>
All details for this employee using the api endpoint

<h3> On the Add Page <h3>
Allow user to add all the fields for an employee
Let user know that the person was added successfully
